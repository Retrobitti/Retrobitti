## About me

Hello! I'm an ICT engineering student with a passion for cloud! I'm currently learning Linux and following a DevOps roadmap to become a DevOps engineer. As a software developer my stongest tools are SQL, JavaScript(Node.js, React.js, React Native). I have stronger knowledge of backend but lately 
I have been doing development in React Native and learning a lot about frontend development as well. I also have experience in Git and Scrum.

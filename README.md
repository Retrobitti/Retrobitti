## About me

Hello! I'm an ICT engineering student with a passion for cloud! I'm fascinated by the concept of DevOps and want to pursue that or Full Stack development as my career. 
My strongest skills are JavaScript(Node.js, React), Laravel/PHP, SQL and Java. During my time as a trainee I have built public Rest API and a tool for creating forms and managing data collected with them. 
When it comes to job experience I'm still new to the field but I am very motivated to learn more and become a professional.
